# Cartoonify Image

The "Cartoonify Image" project is a Python application that transforms regular images into cartoon-like versions. It applies image processing techniques and filters to give images a hand-drawn, cartoon-like appearance.

## Features

- **Image loading:** The application allows users to load various image formats, including JPEG, PNG, and GIF.
- **Cartonify algorithm:** We have implemented a custom cartonify algorithm that applies image processing techniques to convert the input image into a cartoon-like version.
- **Adjustable parameters:** Users can tweak various parameters such as line intensity, color saturation, and edge detection threshold to control the level of cartoonification.
- **Real-time preview:** The application provides a real-time preview of the cartonified image, allowing users to visualize the changes before saving the final result.
- **Save cartonified image:** Users can save the transformed image in their preferred image format to their local system.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the main Python script, `cartonify.py`.
3. Load an image of your choice using the application's interface.
4. Adjust the parameters to achieve the desired cartoon effect.
5. Preview the cartonified image in real-time.
6. Once satisfied with the result, save the transformed image to your local system.
